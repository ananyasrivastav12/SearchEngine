Breakdown - 
The src folder contains file pagerank.txt which has all the required functions

Description - 
This project implements the pagerank algorithm using the random surfer method.

The pagerank function and the inlinks function are tthe two most important functions of the file. Pagerank function follows the algorithm given in the book and the slides. Converge() is a helper method which helps to see the stopping criteria for this type of PRalgorithm.

The convergence() function checks the distance between two points using the L2 norm, and compares it with the value of tau. 

The inlinks() function divides a graph into Pages, and Links. It also gives the inlinks count. 

The pagerank() function is an iterative function and gives the final pagerank values for a set of links at its termination.

Libraries -  
Collections, gzip and math are imported to help with the counter, .gz files and sqrts respectively.

Dependancies -
There are no significat dependancies for this project

Building and Runing - 
To run the code, put the following in the command line

Python3 src/pagerank.py

This would run the code with default arguements

To run the code with prefered arguements - 
Python3 src/pagerank.py inputFile lambda_val tau inLinksFile pagerankFile k 

example - Python3 src/pagerank.py linksFileGZ lambda tau inLinksFile pagerankFile k
